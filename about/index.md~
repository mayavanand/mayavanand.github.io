Hello!  My name is Maya Anand and I attend Columbia University (specifically, Columbia College, Class of 2017).  I am majoring in Information Science and concentrating in Biology. Information Science is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Computer Science Department that focues on uderstanding how information is organized, accessed, stored, distributed and processed in today's society. I am focusing specifically on the application of computer science and statistics on the health sciences.  I plan to pursue an MD/PhD and a career as a physician-scientist, researching in the field of bioinformatics or epidemiology.
