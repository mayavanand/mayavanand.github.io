This week I spent a lot of time working on finalizing the posts on this website as well as writing my final report.  I also worked on cleaning up the files saved to various lab servers over the course of my project and on the S3 bucket for my project so that all scripts/files were appropriately documented and only the necessary files to reproduce my work and the final results were saved. I also mapped the 41 categories of Ancestry from our Ancestry pipeline to the 5 superpopulations supplied by the 1000 Genomes Project to compare the results from the pipeline to the "true" results supplied by the 1000 Genomes Project.
