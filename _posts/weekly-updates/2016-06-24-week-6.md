This week I learned about S3 storage on AWS and created a bucket on S3 to store all the data and scripts from my project. I also learned about some strategies for debugging shell scripts and set -x and set -e.  I worked on creating .hap files from each vcf file for the samples in the 1000 genomes project and creating ped files so we can later use IBD to determine if any of the 1000 genomes samples are related.
