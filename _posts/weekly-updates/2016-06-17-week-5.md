This week I got an introduction to emacs and switched from coding in vi to emacs. It was strange at first to switch, but once I got used to emacs I really liked it. I worked on refactoring some of my python code from last week and testing the code on some 23andMe files from OpenSNP.  I also learned about system administration and linux distribution and how to install programs using apt-get and make/make install and pip install. We went over scp and rsync, error codes and if/conditionals in shell. I also learned about using sed.  To verify my VCF  to 23&Me conversions script and make sure I had the full pipeline of scripts, we started EC2 instances with AWS and ran the scripts on all the 1000 genomes project data.  This ended up taking multiple instances and several days for the scripts to run.
