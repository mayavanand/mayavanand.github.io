#Programs

## PLINK
*  whole genome association analysis toolset
*  does a lot of different things: data management, summary statistics for quality control, population stratification detection, basic association testing, multimarker predictors, haplotypic tests, copy number variant analysis, etc.
*  [More details on website](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)

## SAMTOOLS
* Utilities for manipulating alignments in the SAM, BAM, CRAM format: includes sorting, merging, indexing, generating alignments in a per-position format
* samtools pileup -v inputfile.bam -> generates a vcf
* samtools phase -> call and phase heterozygous SNPs
* samtools bam2fq -> converts bam into FASTQ file formats

##BCFTOOLS
* set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the vcf and bcf files
* convert 23andme into VCF: bcftools convert -c ID,CHROM,POS,AA -s SampleName -f 23andme-ref. fa --tsv2vcf 23andme.txt -0z -o out.vcf.gz

##VCFTOOLS
* tools for vcf and bcf files mainly to  summarize data, run calculations on data, filter out data, and convert data into other useful file formats

##TABIX/bgzip
* TABIX indexes tab-delimited genome position file and creates an index file
* input file needs to be position sorted and compressed by bgzip
